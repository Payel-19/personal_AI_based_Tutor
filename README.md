# Personal AI-Based Tutor

## Overview

Personal AI-Based Tutor is a machine learning-powered system that recommends personalized learning materials (videos and PDFs) to students based on their understanding of a course. The model considers assessment scores, feedback, and quiz results to suggest well-explained resources when a student struggles and provide all available videos for selection.

## Features

- **Student Performance Analysis:** Predicts student scores using machine learning.
- **Personalized Learning Recommendations:** Suggests learning materials based on student performance.
- **Automatic PDF & Video Suggestions:** Provides both basic and explained resources.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop:** Allows students to request detailed explanations.
- **Data Visualization:** Generates insights from student performance data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (RandomForestRegressor, Label Encoding, Standard Scaling)
- **Flask/Django (Optional)** for API backend
- **Web Integration** (webbrowser module to open links)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python (>=3.8)
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn PyPDF2
   ```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh

   ```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Personal_AI_Based_Tutor.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Personal_AI_Based_Tutor
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upload a student dataset (`large dataset for predictions.csv`).
2. The model will analyze and predict student performance.
3. Students receive personalized learning materials (PDFs & videos).
4. Users can click on links to open PDFs and watch videos.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrating **Generative AI (Maya AI)** for interactive explanations.
- Developing a **Web Application** for better user experience.
- Adding a **Student Dashboard** with performance tracking.
